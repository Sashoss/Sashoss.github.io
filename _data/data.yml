    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Quantitative and Systems Biology PhD student and my research focusses on characterizing transcriptome profile of pan-cancer Tumor Endothelial Cells to facilitate cancer treatment.
      
      My research interests are:
      1. Directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into specialized endothelial cells called tip and stalk.
      2. Study role of specialized endothelial cells and cancer stem cells in promoting cancer metastasis.
      3. Design computational models to study stemness and angiogenesis in Tumor Microenvironment.
      4. Multimodal transcriptomic data analysis and biological inference.
